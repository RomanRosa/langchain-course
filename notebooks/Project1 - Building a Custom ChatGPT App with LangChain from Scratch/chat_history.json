When an alternating current (AC) passes through the primary winding, it creates a fluctuating magnetic field in the core, which induces a voltage in the secondary winding. By manipulating the number of turns in the windings, transformers can either step up (increase) or step down (decrease) the voltage and current levels, making them essential for electricity distribution and power transmission systems.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "type": "ai", "example": false}}, {"type": "human", "data": {"content": "Explain me in few sentences the concept of transformers in the field of artificial intelligence", "additional_kwargs": {}, "type": "human", "example": false}}, {"type": "ai", "data": {"content": "In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), transformers refer to a type of deep learning model that is highly effective for various tasks involving natural language processing (NLP).

This enables transformers to understand complex dependencies and contextual information, leading to improved performance in tasks such as language translation, text generation, sentiment analysis, and more.
